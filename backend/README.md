# BACKEND DEVELOPERS

hi backend developer, I'm glad to have you with me on this project and to learn a lot from you.
a [models.yaml](.models.yaml) file exists in this directory.

- choose a model for your work
- create a new directory in backend
- add a README explaining your work and how to start it up
- build your api
- be as detailed as possible by adding comments to your code, because we're learning and want to learn from you
- create a new models.yaml file in your folder and put in the models you're building
- add your personal touch and leave us a short explanation in your README
- by doing a push add you file mongodbcompass, insomnia in json format

NB: as for me, I'm a French speaker and, like everyone else, less experienced in programming, so please be indulgent and patient if you're an English speaker and, what's more, more experienced.

thank you for your contribution, together let's restore africa and africans to their former glory
